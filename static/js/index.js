      " the above-mentioned objective, machines need to be trained with textual data. For the purpose of training the machine, first, the textual training data is pre-processed "+
      "in different ways based on the end objective. The rudimentary preprocessing techniques that are often used are tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal. "+
      "These techniques which are considered baseline are used in some basic applications like document similarity and topic modeling among others. There are other techniques such "+
      "as parts-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition that is used in combination with the previously mentioned baseline techniques for more complex applications like document "+
